Week 2 assignment:
    Exercise 1:
        Run sort_names.py to sort names alphabetically, by length or both.
        Takes "a", "l" or "al" as console input.

        Run letter_counter.py to get the combined count of each letter (not case sensitive).

    Exercise 2:
        Run log_filter.py to filter the log file by keyword.
        Takes keyword as console input (not case sensitive).

    Exercise 3:
        Run data_migration.py to create file with "corrected" data entries and a file with complete data entries after correction.
        Additionally a log file is created for the changes made to the data entries.

        I did struggle a bit with finding smart ways to identify errors and the many different scenarios quickly made my code hard to manage.

    Exercise 4:
        Run housing_prices_analysis.py to print first 10 rows of the dataset and average price by region.
        Three different groupings are plotted.

    Exercise Northwind Foods:
        Run sql_connection.py to see the 3 plots made from the Northwind Foods SQL database.
